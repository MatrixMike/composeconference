C◦mp◦se sponsorship directly benefits the functional programming community as proceeds go towards operating costs that includes speaker travel expenses, diversity efforts, and provisioning sustenance at the event. As a sponsor, your company will be positioned for high-visibility as well as be given access to post to our job board or even the opportunity to host your own recruiting event or workshop.

To find out how to be a sponsor, please take a look at [this page](prospectus) for information. If you would like additional information on sponsorship, please contact us at: admin@composeconference.org.
