          <p>
            I will be running a workshop on building a basic Haskell web service.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of devs work in web <em>(all the ones I work with at least ;))</em>, and
            it’s sometimes hard to get off the ground when it comes to doing
            'real work' at the same time as learning Haskell.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal for this workshop is for all attendees to have a working CRUD webservice
            connecting to a database that they can then extend. Depending on time
            limits, we can then discuss changing databases, adding additional
            endpoints and return types, and adding unit testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use the Servant framework for this. The database connection will
            be to SQLite, avoiding a more complicated setup.  Therefore the
            only dependency will be stack and some development libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd imagine that this would be done in around 2 hours, although I can
            provide a little more clarity on that when I’ve done a practice run
            on workmates. Attendees would need a laptop with stack installed and
            an editor setup and running.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will take a step by step approach, introducing the tasks and their
            motivations, and then leaving attendees to complete the steps, pausing
            to help anyone who falls behind.
          </p>

        "prereqs": "
          <p>
            The intended audience will be people who have learnt a little bit of
            Haskell (they are familiar with the syntax) but are interested in
            working through the ins-and-outs of building a web service, e.g.
            transformer-stacks, database-connections, authentication, etc.
