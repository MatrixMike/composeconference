          <!--
          <p>
            I will be running a workshop on building a basic Haskell web service.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of devs work in web <em>(all the ones I work with at least ;))</em>, and
            itâ€™s sometimes hard to get off the ground when it comes to doing
            'real work' at the same time as learning Haskell.
          </p>
          -->
          <p>
            The goal for this workshop is for all attendees to have a working CRUD webservice
            connecting to a database that they can then extend. Depending on time
            limits, we can then discuss changing databases, adding additional
            endpoints and return types, and adding unit testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use the Servant framework. The database connection will
            be to SQLite, avoiding a more complicated setup.  Therefore the
            only dependencies should be stack and some development libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Estimated time is around 2 hours.
            Attendees will need a laptop with Stack installed and
            an editor setup and running.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will take a step by step approach, introducing the tasks and their
            motivations, and then leaving attendees to complete the steps, pausing
            to help anyone who falls behind.
          </p>
        ",
        "prereqs": "
          <p>
            The intended audience will be people who have learnt a little bit of
            Haskell (they are familiar with the syntax) but are interested in
            working through the ins-and-outs of building a web service, e.g.
            transformer-stacks, database-connections, authentication, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attendees will need a laptop with stack installed and an editor setup
            and running. They should also follow the instructions
            <a href='https://github.com/khanage/servant-workshop'>online</a>
            to ensure that they have already downloaded and compiled all the
            necessary dependencies as this could be challenging on site. Briefly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Install the Stack tool and ensure that it is in your $PATH.</li>
            <li>You should have a Haskell editor setup. Atom or something more adventurous (E.g. The one and true editor, Spacemacs)</li>
            <li>Clone https://github.com/khanage/servant-workshop to a handy directory.</li>
            <li>Run <code>stack build</code> and <code>stack test</code></li>
            <li>Then run <code>stack install yesod-bin</code></li>
