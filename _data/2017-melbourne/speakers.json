      <p> 
      Andrew Sorensen is an artist, a programmer, and a computer scientist. His interests are diverse, but unify under a common theme 
      - the programming language as an interface for real-time dialogue between human, machine, and environment. In exploring these 
      ideas Andrew is as likely to be found hacking code in nightclubs as steering scientific codes on distributed high performance 
      computing clusters.  Andrew is well known for creating the programming languages that he uses in live performance to generate 
      audiovisual theatre. He is the author of the Extempore programming language - a systems programming language designed for 
      high-performance 'live' programming.</p>
