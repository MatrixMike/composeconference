        <p>
          If you would like financial assistance to help you attend Compose :: Melbourne,
          then please <a href="mailto:composemel-admin@googlegroups.com">get in touch with the committee</a> with
          details about what help you require.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we are a small new conference, we have a limited financial-assistance budget,
          however we will help where we can!
