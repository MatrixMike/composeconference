          We've endeavoured to answer this question already for you by describing the themes and
          formats we're looking for in presentations on <a href="/2016-melbourne/cfp">the CFP page</a>.
          If you haven't already, please take a look and see if your topic sounds like it would be appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common questions we've received on this topic have been...
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          I want to give a talk about something related to LANGUAGE.
          Can I submit a presentation about that?
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We are currently looking for speakers, and while we're staying in
          line with Compose's theme of typed functional programming, we are
          also aiming to incorporate a wild-card flavour by accepting
          presentations on novel developments and application of FP in the
          arts, so by all means submit a presentation proposal if you feel it
          may be of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proposals are not solely restricted to statically-typed languages, or the languages
          with their logos included on the home-page or CFP page, however,
          please keep in mind the audience, themes, and the fact that the submission
          reviewers will try to select presentations in line with these.

        <p>
          If you do have a paper that your presentation is based on
          then this is also fine, but special consideration won't be given simply
          because of the presence of a paper. Consideration will primarily be based
          on the expected fit and impact of the proposed presentation.

          We're still finalising the venue for the second day of the conference.
          Once this has been done then we will create an Eventbrite event for
          the second day of workshops and unconference.
          This is currently our top-priority.

          The <a href="/2016-melbourne/unconference">Unconference page</a>

          The second day will include workshops, tutorials, and ad-hoc

          We're expecting the audience to be composed of several kinds of people interested
          in recent developments in typed functional-programming and related
          theory and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're explicitly trying to make Compose :: Melbourne friendly to newcomers, both
          through our ticket-pricing and through our instructions to presenters. So you
          should expect the audience to have a large contingent of newcomers and beginners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compose :: Melbourne is being promoted at FP meetup groups in Melbourne so
          you should see an audience representation of people from
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Melbourne Haskell User's Group</li>
          <li>Melbourne Functional User's Group</li>
          <li>Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup</li>
          <li>Clojure Melbourne</li>
          <li>Melbourne Scala User Group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We've also promoted the conference to industry through our contacts, 
          academia through universities, and other community groups that we
          feel may be interested.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, this is the first time that Compose has been run in
          Melbourne and we're as excited as you to find out what the audience
          looks like when the conference runs!
