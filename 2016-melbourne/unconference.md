        <br />

        <p>
          Day two of Compose :: Melbourne will be a smorgasbord of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> and workshops.
          Attendees will be free to present on topics of their choosing throughout the day
          with audiences assembling organically based on interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Workshops will be run in parallel focusing on intruducing new concepts from
          the typed-functional-programming sphere to the curious and engaged.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second day of the conference is going to be a free event to encourage
          interested people in Melbourne to become part of the functional-programming
          community.

          The second day will feature workshops on typed-functional-programming and theory
          topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Compose :: Melbourne committee will be running an "Introduction-To-Haskell"
          workshop for beginners who are interested in diving into the Haskell language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the second day is a largely-unstructured event, if you wish to run
          a workshop then please <a href="mailto:composemel-admin@googlegroups.com">get in touch with the committee</a>
          to let them know so that they can advertise that your work will be there for others.
          Also, if your workshop requires more than spontaneous organisation then
          getting in touch is a must!

          that you are planning to announce an unconference talk on the day
          then we would be happy to hear from you so that we can get a feel for
