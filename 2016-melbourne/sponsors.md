C◦mp◦se :: Melbourne sponsorship directly benefits the functional programming community as
proceeds go towards operating costs that includes speaker travel expenses,
diversity efforts, and provisioning sustenance at the event. As a sponsor, your
company will be positioned for high-visibility in the Melbourne community.

To find out how to be a sponsor, please take a look at
[this page](https://github.com/composeconference/Compose-Melbourne/wiki/Sponsorship-Tiers)
for information. If you would like additional information on sponsorship,
