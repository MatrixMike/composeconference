		        <h3>Diversity Policy</h3>
		        <p>
		          Platitudes are cheap. We've all heard services say they're committed
		          to "diversity" and "tolerance" without ever getting specific, so
		          here's our stance on it:
		        </p>
		        <p><strong>We welcome you.</strong></p>
		        <p>
		          We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race,
		          ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification. We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes, musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people, extraordinary people, and everyone in between. We welcome people who want to change the world, people who want to keep in touch with friends, people who want to make great art, and people who just need a break after work. We welcome fans, geeks, and nerds.  We welcome you no matter if the Internet was a household word by the time you started secondary school or whether you were already retired by the time the World Wide Web was invented.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We welcome you. You may wear a baby sling, hijab, a kippah, leather, piercings, a pentacle, a political badge, a rainbow, a rosary, tattoos, or something we can only dream of. You may carry a guitar or knitting needles or a sketchbook. Conservative or liberal, libertarian or socialist - we believe it's possible for people of all viewpoints and persuasions to come together and learn from each other. We believe in the broad spectrum of individual and collective experience and in the inherent dignity of all people. We believe that amazing things come when people from different worlds and world-views approach each other to create a conversation.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We get excited about creativity - from pro to amateur, from novels to haiku, from the photographer who's been doing this for decades to the person who just picked up a sketchbook last week. We support maximum freedom of creative expression, within the few restrictions we need to keep the service viable for other users. We're serious about knowing and protecting your rights when it comes to free expression and privacy. We will never put a limit on your creativity just because it makes someone uncomfortable - even if that someone is us.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We think accessibility for people with disabilities is a priority, not an afterthought. We think neurodiversity is a feature, not a bug. We believe in being inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of anyone who comes to us with good faith and the desire to build a community.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We have enough experience to know that we won't get any of this perfect on the first try. But we have enough hope, energy, and idealism to want to learn things we don't know now. We may not be able to satisfy everyone, but we can certainly work to avoid offending anyone. And we promise that if we get it wrong, we'll listen carefully and respectfully to you when you point it out to us,
		          and we’ll do our best to make good on our mistakes.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We think our technical and business experience is important, but we think our community experience is more important. We know what goes wrong when companies say one thing and do another, or when they refuse to say anything at all. We believe that keeping our operations transparent is just as important as keeping our servers stable.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We use the service we're selling, and we built it because we wanted it ourselves. We won't treat people as second-class undesirables because they're non-mainstream or might frighten advertisers. We don't have advertisers to frighten. To us, you're not eyeballs. You're not page views. You're not demographic groups. You're people.
		        </p>
		        <p>Come dream with us.</p>

		        <h3>Anti Harassment Policy</h3>
		        <p>
		          We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
		          experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
		          disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
		          not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
		          Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
		          venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules
		          may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at
		          the discretion of the conference organizers.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          Any form of written, social media, or verbal communication that can
		          be offensive or harassing to any attendee, speaker or staff is not
		          allowed. Please inform a staff member if you feel a
		          violation has taken place and the conference leadership team will
		          address the situation.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
		          sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
		          race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
		          intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or
		          recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
		          inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
		          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
		          comply immediately.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
		          activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
		          particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
		          or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
		          sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
		          sexualized environment.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
		          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
		          warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
		          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
		          harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
		          conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by
		          t-shirts and special badges.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact
		          hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
		          otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
		          duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		          We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues
		          and conference-related social events.
		        </p>
