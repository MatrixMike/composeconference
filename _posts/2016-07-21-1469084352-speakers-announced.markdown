C◦mp◦se :: Melbourne is extremely pleased to announce the line-up of presenters
for <a href="/2016-melbourne/day-one-program/">Day-One</a>
of the conference! We had a total of 31 excellent submissions after extending
the CFP, and have selected 10 of these for our program.

The program is made-up of a technically diverse selection of presentations that
should be accessible to a wide variety of skill-levels, as well as touching on
many different interests, including new-languages, graphics, theory, industry,
data-science, and type-driven-development. The first day of C◦mp◦se :: Melbourne
will open with a keynote from Manuel Chakravarty on Graphics and Animations in
Haskell.

The presentations are listed below but more details can be found on the
<a href="/2016-melbourne/day-one-program/">Day-One</a>
program page!
