The second day of Compose :: Melbourne will feature workshops on
typed-functional-programming and theory topics.

The Compose :: Melbourne committee will be running an "Introduction-To-Haskell"
workshop for beginners who are interested in diving into the Haskell language.
As well as the Haskell workshop, Luke Stephenson will be running a workshop
on working with free-monads in conjunction with free-applicatives,
and Rob Howard will be running a introductory
Purescript workshop in the afternoon. There will be <strong>even <em>more</em></strong>
free workshops throughout the day that are not currently listed! Keep your
eyes open!

Although the second day is a largely-unstructured event, if you wish to run
a workshop then please <a href="mailto:composemel-admin@googlegroups.com">get in touch with the committee</a>
to let them know so that they can advertise that your work will be there for others.
Also, if your workshop requires more than spontaneous organisation then
getting in touch is a must!

See the <a href="/2016-melbourne/unconference">unconference page</a> for more details.
