We have received 31 outstanding presentation proposals and are now in the
painstaking process of reviewing submissions to determine the schedule
for Day-One of Compose :: Melbourne 2016!

We will be responding to presenters on Friday and will then be announcing
the speakers and presentations shortly. We're very excited to promote
a fantastic showcase of talks that we have received and are looking foward
to sharing them with you all!

We've had presentations submitted involving Haskell,
 Scala, Elm, Purescript, Java, Pawns,
 Mercury, Stanza, Coq, Clojure, Isabelle,
 HOL, Plasma, Ruby and Swift.

While we won't be able to fit in all of the proposed presentations on
Day-One, we're hoping that the Day-Two unconference allows even more
of the proposals to be shared with the Compose :: Melbourne audience.
