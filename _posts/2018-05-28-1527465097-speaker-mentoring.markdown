Compose :: Melbourne is proud to announce that we have created a
[Gitter.im community](https://gitter.im/Compose-Melbourne-2018-Mentoring/Lobby)
to provide mentoring for prospective speakers.

Sign in with your Github, Gitlab, or Twitter account to chat with members of
the committee, and other volunteers from the FP community.
You can chat in the lobby channel, or directly message admins to set up
a private session.

We want you to feel comfortable submitting a talk, stop by for help with your
submission. We can help validate your talk ideas, structure, timing, and
more.

Looking forward to seeing you!
