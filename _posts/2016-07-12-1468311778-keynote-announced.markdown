Manuel M T Chakravarty is an Associate Professor at the University of
New South Wales. His core research interests are functional
programming, novel compiler technology, and high-performance computing.
He graduated from the University of Karlsruhe and received a doctoral
degree from the Berlin Institute of Technology. His major contributions
include work on Haskell’s foreign function interface, the <strong>C&nbsp;→&nbsp;Haskell</strong>
binding generator, the theory and implementation of type families in
the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and the development of multiple systems
for data parallel programming of multicore CPUs and GPUs, including
Accelerate, Data Parallel Haskell, and Repa.

He is the principal author
of the interactive development environment
<a href="http://haskellformac.com/">Haskell for Mac</a> and he is
excited by the opportunities presented by the Swift programming
language. Most importantly, he believes in the fruitful combination of
theory and practice.
